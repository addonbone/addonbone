# Runtime data

`RuntimeDataPlugin` embeds a serializable snapshot known before filename hashing. It does not emit
a carrier file, fetch metadata or connect another entrypoint's JavaScript. `update(data)` changes
the next compilation's snapshot, including watch rebuilds.

The optional `test(entry)` selects entrypoints by name. Without it, every runtime receives the data,
preserving the page and Relay getters' current availability. With a shared runtime chunk, matching
any consuming entrypoint selects that runtime. The selector does not inspect API usage or tree-shake
individual map entries. Excluding a runtime that calls the corresponding getter is the caller's error.

Insertion is guarded once per runtime and plugin instance within each compilation. Distinct properties
can coexist. Guard and snapshot state are refreshed per compilation, not retained across rebuilds.
