# Locale

`src/locale` implements translation at runtime: message lookup, substitutions, plural forms, language selection, and UI integration. Its public entrypoints are `adnbn/locale` and `adnbn/locale/react`.

## Directory responsibilities

| Area                          | Responsibility                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `providers/AbstractLocale.ts` | Common string rendering, plural rules, missing-message diagnostics, and language names.                                       |
| `providers/NativeLocale.ts`   | Browser i18n message lookup and a singleton used by the public helpers.                                                       |
| `providers/DynamicLocale.ts`  | Compiled translations, language state per instance, and optional storage synchronization.                                     |
| `providers/CustomLocale.ts`   | Internal provider for an explicitly supplied language and flat message dictionary; not re-exported by the public entrypoint.  |
| `helpers.ts`                  | Native shortcuts: `t`, `choice`, `key` for browser message references, and `resolve` for strings prefixed with `@`.           |
| `utils.ts`                    | Key conversion, locale markers, language resolution, and text direction.                                                      |
| `catalogue/`                  | Empty package fallback and typing for the generated data module.                                                              |
| `storage/`                    | Built-in `LocaleStorage` implementation of the public `LocaleStorageDriver` contract.                                         |
| `adapters/react/`             | `LocaleProvider`, its context, and `useLocale`; connects dynamic localization to React state and DOM `lang`/`dir` attributes. |
| `index.ts`                    | Public providers, helpers, and selected shared contracts.                                                                     |

## Ownership and data flow

Shared languages, contracts, and module identifiers belong to `src/types/locale.ts`. It also declares the empty `LocaleRegistry`, re-exported through `adnbn/locale`. Generated `.adnbn/locale.d.ts` augments that registry, defining the application's keys and required substitutions from its default language for providers, helpers, and adapters.

Locale discovery, merging, validation, fallback preparation, native `_locales/*/messages.json`, and declaration generation belong to the CLI locale pipeline. The locale feature plugin supplies the generated data; Rspack integration and chunk delivery belong to the bundler. Shared message-flattening logic lives in `src/shared/locale`.

During extension builds, the private `#adnbn/locale` import resolves to `virtual/locale`: a default catalogue export plus named `keys`, `languages`, and `lang` (the configured default language). `DynamicLocale` reads the catalogue; `NativeLocale` imports only the named lists, allowing unused translations to be removed from optimized bundles. Outside these builds, `catalogue/` provides a resolvable empty module with `lang: "en"`.

Views and ISOLATED content scripts can share `locale.js`. MAIN retains its own content layer: its catalogue stays in the entrypoint or joins `common-main.content.js` under the regular content chunk rules. Background keeps translations in its single bundle. This separates file delivery across content execution worlds; the same translations may occur in their respective bundles.

Core providers have no React dependency. Browser i18n access goes through `@addon-core/browser`; `DynamicLocale` delegates persistence to `LocaleStorageDriver`. The built-in `LocaleStorage` uses `@addon-core/storage`. Both native and dynamic providers determine their initial language from the browser's `locale` message. If that call fails or its marker cannot be resolved, `DynamicLocale` uses the generated `lang`. `NativeLocale` still requires browser i18n. The empty package fallback contains no translations; `DynamicLocale` requires a generated catalogue containing its selected language.

## Runtime behavior

Translations are synchronous strings. Providers share substitution and plural processing through `AbstractLocale`; `trans` handles non-plural keys and `choice` selects a form by count. Substitutions accept strings and numbers. Generated public keys use dot notation, while message lookup converts them to underscore keys. Missing messages warn and return the key; empty translations remain empty strings.

`DynamicLocale` reads bundled messages without fetching JSON or dynamically importing languages. `change()` updates its state immediately and returns a promise for saving the language code. Without a constructor argument it creates `LocaleStorage`, which uses extension local storage with the fixed namespace `PackageName` (`adnbn`) and default key `locale`. Pass another key to `new LocaleStorage("customLocale")`; the constructor stores it in the protected `key` property used for reading, writing, and watching. Passing `false` to `DynamicLocale` keeps state only in the instance; passing a `LocaleStorageDriver` uses that object directly.

In MAIN, use `new DynamicLocale(false)` or supply a custom driver that does not require extension APIs. Translations and language changes work from the bundle, starting with the configured default language. The built-in driver is intended for ISOLATED and extension pages.

Storage initialization is explicit: `sync()` reads the saved language, `watch()` observes subsequent storage events, and `unwatch()` disconnects. The constructor does neither. `watch()` is not a general subscription to in-memory state; `sync()` and `watch()` require enabled storage. The current React provider connects these methods on mount and exposes their results through context.

`LocaleStorageDriver` provides `get(): Promise<Language | undefined>`, `set(lang): Promise<void>`, and `watch(handler): () => void`. Reading an absent value leaves the current language unchanged. Notifications contain only valid language codes, including own writes, with no initial notification or deletion event. `LocaleStorage` ignores absent values and diagnoses malformed codes; `DynamicLocale` additionally checks that a language exists in its catalogue. Read and write errors propagate to callers. Custom drivers own their persistence and notifications; pass the same driver to providers that should share its state.
